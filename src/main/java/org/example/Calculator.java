 ****************************
 * TODO New assignment!!
 *  If too daunting no worries, we can do this together in class
 *  Implement a Calculator class.
 *  The class Calculator will abstract over the accumulated result of basic arithmetic calculations
 *  For that the class will hold as its state such accumulated result.
 *  Every Calculator object will be created with an initial state = 0.
 *  It will provide methods to:
 *  - Addition (sum). This method will receive as a parameter a decimal value,
 *   and change the state of the object accordingly. It must return void (no return).
 *  - Subtraction. Same as addition
 *  - Multiplication. Same
 *  - Division. Same
 *  - Square root. Same
 *  It will also provide a method to query the accumulated result of all calculations performed
 *  It will provide another method to reset to state of the object to zero (0)

// New assignment for the weekend (or if too daunting, to review in class next week)
// Implement
public class Calculator {
    // TODO Declare here a private attribute of type double to accumulate the result.
    // Remember that its initial state should be zero,
    // and the caller shouldn't be able to establish that initial state.
    // As we want to be able to modify this state with each method call,
    // we cannot (and shouldn't) make it final.

    // TODO Create a method to add an arbitrary decimal number to the state of the Calculator
    // Name it sum, declare a return type of 'void', and make it public

    // TODO Now do the same for:
    // TODO Subtraction (method name 'minus')

    // TODO Multiplication (method name 'times')

    // TODO Division (method name 'dividedBy')

    // TODO Square root (method name 'sqrt')

    // TODO Create a getter to query the state of the Calculator

    // TODO Implement a method called reset that returns void,
    // and sets the state of the calculator to zero (0)
}
